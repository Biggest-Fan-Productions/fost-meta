If you want to use fost-base in your code you want to add https://github.com/KayEss/fost-base.git to your project.

# Building the Docker container #

The container is aimed at producing a build environment for compiling the Fost libraries and packages.

To build you will need to have a host `apt-cacher` that points to an apt proxy.
